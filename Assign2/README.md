### Additional Features 
- Screens: A title and gameover screen were implemented to imporve general game design.

- Difficulty Settings: (Idea from: https://gitlab.com/freiguy1/elm-snake)
1. Easy -> Slow speed and shorter growth per berry allow for more player control leading to a decreased chance of death.
2. Normal -> Regular speed and growth grant control of snake.
3. Hard -> Faster speed and more growth per berry lead to less control and higher chance of death.

- Some minor styling additions
